## TL;DR

Launch as a PWA targeting women 22-40 in Mumbai/Bangalore/Delhi. Grow through Instagram content + micro-influencer partnerships + product-led growth (sharing outfit screenshots). Hit 1,000 users in month 1, 10,000 by month 6.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-8)

### Build the Waitlist

**Landing Page (closetai.app)**
- Single page: headline, 3 value props, demo video/GIF, email capture
- Headline: "Your closet, but smarter."
- Subhead: "AI-powered outfit suggestions from YOUR actual wardrobe. Stop staring at a full closet saying 'I have nothing to wear.'"
- CTA: "Join the waitlist — first 500 get Pro free for 3 months"

**Waitlist Mechanics:**
- Email capture with referral program
- "Move up the list by sharing" — each referral = +10 positions
- Weekly email updates showing product progress (build in public)
- Target: 500 emails before launch

### Content Seeding

**Instagram Account (@closetai.app)**
- Start posting 3-4 weeks before launch
- Content pillars:
  1. **"Did you know?"** — wardrobe statistics (e.g., "Average woman wears only 30% of her closet")
  2. **"Outfit math"** — show how 10 items = 30+ outfits with the right combinations
  3. **"Closet confessions"** — relatable memes about "nothing to wear"
  4. **Product teasers** — sneak peeks of the app UI, features
  5. **Style tips** — quick styling advice that positions us as experts

**Target:** 1,000 followers before launch

### Micro-Influencer Outreach (20-30 people)

**Who:**
- Fashion micro-influencers (5K-50K followers) in India
- Not mega-celebrities — real women who talk about daily styling
- Focus: Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi (our target cities)
- Mix: working professionals who share OOTD, fashion students, style bloggers

**Offer:**
- Free Premium account for 6 months
- Early access to app before public launch
- "Founding Influencer" badge in app
- Commission on referrals (10% of Pro subscriptions from their unique link)

**Ask:**
- 1 Instagram Story showing them using the app
- 1 feed post/reel about their experience
- Honest feedback (we want real reactions, not scripted ads)

**Budget:** $0 (product-only compensation)

| Daily active users | 200+ |
| App Store-equivalent rating | 4.5+ (feedback survey) |

---

## Phase 3: Growth Loops (Months 2-6)

### Growth Loop 1: Outfit Sharing (Viral)

```
User gets outfit suggestion
    → Taps "Share" → generates beautiful outfit card image
    → Posts to Instagram Story / WhatsApp status
    → Card includes "Made with ClosetAI" watermark + link
    → Friends see → curious → visit closetai.app → sign up
```

**Key design:** The share image must be BEAUTIFUL. Instagram-worthy. Not a screenshot — a designed card with:
- Outfit items arranged aesthetically
- Style score badge
- User's Style DNA archetype
- "closetai.app" subtle branding

**Viral coefficient target:** 0.3 (every 10 users bring 3 new ones)

### Growth Loop 2: Closet Challenge (Social)

```
"The 30-Day Closet Challenge"
    → Use only items in your closet for 30 days (no new purchases)
    → ClosetAI generates daily outfits from existing wardrobe
    → Track and share progress
    → Community leaderboard
    → At end: "You saved ₹X by not impulse-buying"
```

**Positioning:** Sustainability + style + savings = triple win
**Launch timing:** January (New Year's resolution) or before major sales (anti-sale campaign)

### Growth Loop 3: Referral Program

```
Invite a friend → both get 1 month of Pro free
    → Friend signs up and uploads 10+ items
    → Both rewarded
    → Viral: each Pro trial converts at 20% to paid
```

**Economics:** Cost of 1 free Pro month = ~$0.14 (AI cost only). If 20% convert = $1 revenue for $0.14 spend = 7:1 ROI

### Growth Loop 4: Content Marketing (SEO + Social)

**Blog (closetai.app/blog)**
- Weekly articles targeting search intent:
  - "How to build a capsule wardrobe for Indian weather"
  - "Best outfit combinations for 10 basic items"
  - "What colors suit warm skin tones?"
  - "How to dress for Indian office culture"
- Each article includes CTA to try ClosetAI

**YouTube/Reels (monthly)**
- "I let AI pick my outfits for a week" — creator collaboration
- Before/after wardrobe organization
- "Closet audit" — analyzing a real person's wardrobe with the app

---

## Phase 4: Retention & Engagement (Ongoing)

### Daily Engagement Drivers

1. **Morning notification:** "Your outfit for today is ready ☀️" (8 AM)
   - Personalized, includes weather, shows outfit preview
   - Open rate target: 30%+

2. **Streak system:** "7-day outfit streak! 🔥"
   - Consecutive days of accepting outfit suggestions
   - Achievements: 7-day, 30-day, 100-day streaks
   - Shareable milestone cards

3. **Weekly digest:** "This week in your closet" (Sunday)
   - Items worn / not worn
   - Most versatile item
   - Suggestion for next week

### Monthly Engagement

4. **Seasonal wardrobe review** (quarterly)
   - "Monsoon is coming — let's review your rain-ready items"
   - Prompts to add/archive seasonal items

5. **Style DNA evolution**
   - Monthly update: "Your style has shifted toward [more casual]"
   - Comparison with previous months
   - Celebrate positive changes

### Reducing Churn

| Churn Signal | Intervention |
|-------------|-------------|
| No login for 3 days | Push: "Miss us? Here's today's outfit suggestion" |
| No items uploaded for 14 days | Push: "Your closet is waiting — add your latest purchase!" |
| Rejected 5 outfits in a row | In-app: "Outfits not hitting? Let's update your style preferences" |
| Approaching item limit (free) | In-app: "You have 28/30 items. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited" |
| Pro user, low engagement | Email: personal note from founder, ask what's not working |

---

## Target Cities (India Launch)

### Tier 1: Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi-NCR
- Highest concentration of target demographic
- Fashion-forward, tech-savvy
- High smartphone penetration
- Multiple dress code contexts (office + casual + ethnic + party)

### Tier 2 (Month 3+): Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Kolkata
- Growing professional class
- Active Instagram fashion communities
- Lower competition for attention

### Why India First (Not US)
1. **Underserved market:** No dominant wardrobe AI app in India
2. **Complex wardrobes:** Western + ethnic + fusion = MORE value from AI
3. **Lower CAC:** Influencer marketing costs 5-10x less than US
4. **Growing market:** India's fashion e-commerce growing 20%+ YoY
5. **Test & learn:** cheaper to iterate before US expansion
6. **Cultural expertise:** founders are Indian, understand the context

## Marketing Budget (First 6 Months)

| Category | Monthly Budget | Total (6 mo) |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Influencer gifting/commissions | $100 | $600 |
| Instagram/Meta ads (Month 3+) | $200 | $800 |
| Content creation tools | $50 | $300 |
| Domain + hosting | $20 | $120 |
| Press/PR | $0 | $0 |
| **Total** | | **$1,820** |

**Note:** We're bootstrapped. Most growth should be organic (product-led + content + word-of-mouth). Paid ads only after proving organic traction.

## Competitive Moat Over Time

```
Month 1:  Product quality (AI accuracy, beautiful UI)
Month 3:  User data (wardrobe photos, style preferences)
Month 6:  Behavioral data (wear patterns, accept/reject signals)
Month 9:  Network effects (community, shared outfits)
Month 12: Brand relationships (affiliate partnerships, sponsored content)
Month 18: Platform lock-in (too much data to switch)
```
